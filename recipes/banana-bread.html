        <h2>Banana Bread Ingredients</h2>
          <p>You likely already have all the Ingredients you'll need for this banana bread recipe on hand. 
             If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown Sugar:</strong> Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Bananas:</strong> Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
          </ul>
