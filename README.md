Introduction
This is my version of the recipes project on The Odin Project. It's a website for 3 recipes made with just HTML. 

This project shows my understanding of HTML basics as well as how to use git (add, commit, push, etc.)

I was able to finish the project although I had to recheck conventional git commit message several a number of times to make sure I was doing it correctly
